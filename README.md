## Overview
Higurashi Hou+ is the 20th anniversary re-release of the original doujin Higurashi release. It includes all 14 arcs from the original Hou release, plus a new short story called Mehagashi and a new all-cast review session.

This project *only* aims to translate those two new pieces of content, because MangaGamer has announced plans to officially release all the other Hou arcs.

## Prerequisites
This patch requires you have a copy of Hou+. The patch only includes the script and graphic assets that needed to be modified to support an English translation. Hou+ is currently only available physically. You can purchase a copy through [Toranoana](https://ecs.toranoana.jp/tora/ec/app/catalog/list?searchWord=%E3%81%B2%E3%81%90%E3%82%89%E3%81%97%E3%81%AE%E3%81%AA%E3%81%8F%E9%A0%83%E3%81%AB%E5%A5%89%EF%BC%8B) but you'll have to use a proxy because they don't ship outside of Japan. Please support the official release, we cannot provide support for pirated versions.

## Installation Instructions

1. Install Hou+ on your computer from DVD.
2. Download the latest Hou+ English translation patch from [this repository](https://github.com/07th-mod/higurashi-hou-plus/releases/latest). It will be a single zip file.

You can tell which folder is the right one because it will have an executable with this icon: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/20390474/153778167-d8e11336-42a1-4bde-9571-7f88f495527e.png)
