# Higurashi Hou+ English Translation Project

Higurashi Hou+ is the 20th anniversary rerelease of the original doujin Higurashi release. It includes all 14 arcs from the original Hou release, plus a new short story called Mehagashi and a new all-cast review session. This project only aims to translate those two new pieces of content.

This patch requires you have a copy of Hou+. The patch only includes the script and graphic assets that needed to be modified to support an English translation.
